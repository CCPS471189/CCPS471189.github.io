    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Since I was little, my parents would push me to become a great swimmer and get good grades. I started swimming competitively when I was 4 and I still swim to this day. I have been to every state meet since I was eight, and I have gotten first in two of them. In 2019, I went to an all star meet with five different states, and got fifth place overall, but first in two events. Aside from swimming, I strive to be a good student who excels in athletics and has great grades. Now, I am striving to go D1 as a swimmer at the University of Georgia, where I will live close to my sister and cousins.

I am working hard to get these goals by going to swim practice and school every day. When I don't go to school or swimming, I am always doing something that could prepare me for the real world and achieving my goals. These things include reading, working out, and studying for tests in school.

Some values that I consider necessary for my success are accountability, trustworthiness, being responsible, and kindness.  I believe that accountability and trustworthiness would be good in the future for being able to be trusted by the people around me. I also think that being responsible would be helpful because if someone gives me a task to do, they can be sure I'll get it done. Kindness is also a valuable asset in anything you do because if you are kind to someone, you will receive kindness back.

Some short term goals that I hope to accomplish soon are having a 4.0 gpa, and just getting better at swimming in general. I think that having a 4.0 gpa will help me significantly for finding colleges, and just making me and my parents happy. I also believe that getting better at swimming will make me and my coaches a lot happier.

Some character traits that I want to be known for are trustworthiness, kindness, being responsible, having good goals, striving to be great. I believe that these are good goals to have because if you can't be trusted, then people won't let you do a lot of stuff. Same goes with everything else, if you aren't kind, people won't be kind to you, and if you aren't striving to be great, then you won't become great.</p>
